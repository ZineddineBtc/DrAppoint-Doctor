# DrAppoint-Doctor
An Android app that connects patients to doctors. (doctor side of DrAppoint repo)

## Features
doctors can receive lists of patients that booked appointments for a certain date.

## Libraries and APIs
The app uses Firebase authentication and Firestore (NoSQL database). Also SQLite is used for offline database (bookmarks, history...).<br/>

## Progress
Development is advanced. Not so much to be added as the app has limited tasks.
